# NFTHashi 2022 Web3 Inifinity Hackathon Edition

## Development Principle

- make it stupid simple
- no monorepo integration for packages, leave it as separated package
- minimum code linting fixing

### Frontend

- No atomic design, just simple components
- Mainly use Chakra UI, use MUI if specific component is required, use tailwind for custom design

## Running in Local
